# PCDHA9-ALS-Candidate-Gene-Functional-Identification
Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a devastating neurodegenerative disease. To identify additional genetic contributors to ALS, we analyzed exome sequences in a large cohort of Chinese ALS patients.We found a homozygous variant (p.L700P) in PCDHA9 in three unrelated patients but not in publicly available genomic databases.
